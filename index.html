  The Main Character’s name is Francis but really, the important thing to know is that he’s the Main Character even if he doesn’t know it and even if the world really doesn’t seem to know it. He lives in Omaha, Nebraska, USA, Earth, etc. He is the central gear in the large constantly churning machine of the universe and if he breaks, if he’s removed or even if he just doesn’t really feel like turning anymore the entire universe is going to come to a halt. You might not notice it. You might have a family and your friends and the things that are happening with those family members and those friends are still going to seem important. They’re still going to matter to you, but in the big grand scheme of things they aren’t going to matter much at all, especially if Francis isn’t involved. They are just side stories and if the Main Character cancels the Main Storyline then who cares about the little B and C plots. The diehard fans, I guess. The point is there is a Main Character and it isn’t you, it’s Francis.

<p>The Main Character has built a self-contained ecosystem in a terrarium in his bedroom. He stares into it every day when he gets home from school. He runs across the lawn of his parents’ two-story house in suburban Omaha and lets himself in the front door and carrrumphs up the stairs to his bedroom which looks out over a lovely backyard with a trampoline and a treehouse and a porch that his dad didn’t stain properly. He throws his backpack on his bed and runs over to his desk where the giant bottle-shaped glass terrarium sits, the top of which is foggy and clouded.</p>
<p>He watched YouTube videos on how to make the terrarium, a channel called PollysLilPlants which gave recommendations on the best container to use, the best soil, which tropical plants to buy, how many tropical plants to buy, how to make sure life develops, how to make sure that you get kind of a primordial soup going in the little tiny lake you’ve built in the middle of the terrarium, how to make sure that the teeny tiny fish-like creatures that evolve in the primordial soup eventually begin to explore the land, what tropical genetic lines to buy to make sure that there is a nice mix of carnivores and herbivores once land species evolve, how many tropical genetic lines to buy, how to avoid excessive mold. PollysLilPlants covered it all.</p>
<p>In the cafeteria at school, eating Valley View High School’s Vegetarian Pizza which tastes like rubber and the Otis Spunkmeyer Chocolate Chip Cookie which just tastes, overall, gooey, he tells his best friend Charlie about the civilization that is developing on the edges of the lake within his terrarium.</p>
<p>“They’ve moved on from stick huts and are now experimenting with fire-hardened mud bricks,” the Main Character tells his friend who is licking chocolate from the grooves between his fingers. “It’s really impressive. Just last week they developed what I think is a writing system, but I don’t have enough samples yet to begin trying to translate.”</p>
<p>Charlie looks bored and the Main Character can tell he isn’t really listening. Charlie has pulled out his phone and is flicking through pornographic pictures while the Main Character talks.</p>
<p>“Cool,” his friend says. “I had something like that once as a kid. My mom got me a sea monkey kit and I dumped all these little eggs or dehydrated bodies or something into a big tank with a castle at the bottom. They all came to life and swam around like crazy for about a day and then all died and sank to the bottom. Apparently you can’t just use regular tap water, at least in Nebraska.”</p>
<p>"It’s not like that,” the Main Character says, growing frustrated. He stands up to throw away most of his pizza. “It’s not like that at all.”

<p>The Main Character’s therapist Claudette asks him if he likes her. </p>

  What do you mean?

       It seems like you have to really put a lot of effort into getting words out when you talk with me

       Oh

       I think I’m just really worried about how you perceive me

       Well that’s stupid. I thought you hated me

  <p>The Main Character’s dentist also criticizes him but he feels that the proof is in the cavity-filled pudding there.

<p>The terrarium is built to be entirely self-sustaining. The water evaporates and cools and rains and recycles itself all on its own although sometimes the Main Character will take the cork stopper off the top of the bottle and quickly spray some mist into the ecosystem he’s created. Other times he will let some of the moisture escape through the top if the little citizens of the world within the bottle seem to be a bit too wet for too much of the time. It’s really a careful balance. One time he and his family went on vacation and he left the terrarium too close to a window and the sun, reflected through two different layers of glass, basically acted like a laser beam cutting through the midst of the tiny rainforest.</p>
<p>When the Main Character returned he saw that the small villages that had been developing within the tank were decimated and there were now a hundred or so tiny little grave stones placed along the shores of the minuscule lake. The survivors in the villages were all wearing highly-reflective clothing covered in lots of little geodesic baubles which seemed to create a constant shadow surrounding the wearer. It was really a significant technological advance for the tiny civilization, although the end result was that all the small people walking around looked like misshapen disco balls. The Main Character felt awful about the whole situation.

<p>At school there is a girl named Taylor that the Main Character is in love with. The Main Character is a decent artist and he draws her over and over, alone in his bedroom, from memory. Or rather, he draws her face from memory. Sometimes he draws her clothes from memory too but other times he draws her without clothes and that is purely imagination. He draws what he imagines she would look like naked and he masturbates to his own drawings and then feels disgusted with himself. He feels ashamed and tears up the drawings into tiny pieces to flush down the toilet with the tissue paper containing his semen or he balls them up into wads and throws them away or sometimes he just turns to the next page in his notebook so that the image is covered with a new fresh sheet. Sometimes he peeks back at the drawings he left intact.
</p>
<p>
  He writes poems about her too. He thinks his poems are actually really good and thinks that if Taylor were to read his poems that maybe she would view him as a romantic option, maybe she would view him as someone worth paying special attention to, and so he puts one on Facebook but of course changes the name in the poem from Taylor to Olivia so that no one could tell that it was about a real person, there wasn’t even an Olivia at his school.</p>
  <p>
    Taylor reads the poem and leaves a comment on his Facebook post saying that the poem is actually really good and at school, in chemistry class, at a lab table which is like a regular table but very high off the ground and made of black laminate, she leans close to him, leans over with her elbow on the table and is almost falling off the silver metal stools they all have to sit on, and asks him, “So, who’s this Olivia?” And the way she says Olivia is almost taunting, really hitting the VEE and the YA. And the LIV for that matter. She wiggles her eyebrows at him and he looks down at her elbow which is wrinkled up on the tabletop. He thinks she has a really beautiful elbow. “Someone I met last summer,” he replies. “You wouldn’t know her. She lives in Lincoln.” Taylor moves back so that she is sitting up straight on her stool again and winks at him.
