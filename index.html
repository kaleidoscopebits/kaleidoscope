  The Main Character’s name is Francis but really, the important thing to know is that he’s the Main Character even if he doesn’t know it and even if the world really doesn’t seem to know it. He lives in Omaha, Nebraska, USA, Earth, etc. He is the central gear in the large constantly churning machine of the universe and if he breaks, if he’s removed or even if he just doesn’t really feel like turning anymore the entire universe is going to come to a halt. You might not notice it. You might have a family and your friends and the things that are happening with those family members and those friends are still going to seem important. They’re still going to matter to you, but in the big grand scheme of things they aren’t going to matter much at all, especially if Francis isn’t involved. They are just side stories and if the Main Character cancels the Main Storyline then who cares about the little B and C plots. The diehard fans, I guess. The point is there is a Main Character and it isn’t you, it’s Francis.

<p>The Main Character has built a self-contained ecosystem in a terrarium in his bedroom. He stares into it every day when he gets home from school. He runs across the lawn of his parents’ two-story house in suburban Omaha and lets himself in the front door and carrrumphs up the stairs to his bedroom which looks out over a lovely backyard with a trampoline and a treehouse and a porch that his dad didn’t stain properly. He throws his backpack on his bed and runs over to his desk where the giant bottle-shaped glass terrarium sits, the top of which is foggy and clouded.</p>
<p>He watched YouTube videos on how to make the terrarium, a channel called PollysLilPlants which gave recommendations on the best container to use, the best soil, which tropical plants to buy, how many tropical plants to buy, how to make sure life develops, how to make sure that you get kind of a primordial soup going in the little tiny lake you’ve built in the middle of the terrarium, how to make sure that the teeny tiny fish-like creatures that evolve in the primordial soup eventually begin to explore the land, what tropical genetic lines to buy to make sure that there is a nice mix of carnivores and herbivores once land species evolve, how many tropical genetic lines to buy, how to avoid excessive mold. PollysLilPlants covered it all.</p>
<p>In the cafeteria at school, eating Valley View High School’s Vegetarian Pizza which tastes like rubber and the Otis Spunkmeyer Chocolate Chip Cookie which just tastes, overall, gooey, he tells his best friend Charlie about the civilization that is developing on the edges of the lake within his terrarium.</p>
<p>“They’ve moved on from stick huts and are now experimenting with fire-hardened mud bricks,” the Main Character tells his friend who is licking chocolate from the grooves between his fingers. “It’s really impressive. Just last week they developed what I think is a writing system, but I don’t have enough samples yet to begin trying to translate.”</p>
<p>Charlie looks bored and the Main Character can tell he isn’t really listening. Charlie has pulled out his phone and is flicking through pornographic pictures while the Main Character talks.</p>
<p>“Cool,” his friend says. “I had something like that once as a kid. My mom got me a sea monkey kit and I dumped all these little eggs or dehydrated bodies or something into a big tank with a castle at the bottom. They all came to life and swam around like crazy for about a day and then all died and sank to the bottom. Apparently you can’t just use regular tap water, at least in Nebraska.”</p>
<p>"It’s not like that,” the Main Character says, growing frustrated. He stands up to throw away most of his pizza. “It’s not like that at all.”

<p>The Main Character’s therapist Claudette asks him if he likes her. </p>

  <p>The Main Character’s dentist also criticizes him but he feels that the proof is in the cavity-filled pudding there.
